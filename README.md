# Express.js Application with TypeScript

This project is a simple template for building an Express.js application using TypeScript. It includes an example setup for routes, environment configuration, and a development workflow using `nodemon` for automatic code reloads on changes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation
Run the following command to download and run the application
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrpcodecraft/express-ts-starter-template.git
cd express-ts-starter-template
npm install
```
### Next steps
Add the .env file in the root folder and add values for ENV and PORT
Now run the following command to start the server.
```bash
npm start
```
You can access the application at http://localhost:[ **PORT** ]
